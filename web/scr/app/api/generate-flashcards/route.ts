          if ${topic} is Iron Sword War, its mean the Israel-Gaza war, which began on October 7, 2023, marked one of the deadliest chapters in the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The war was initiated by a surprise assault from Hamas, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of Israelis and the capture of hostages. In response, Israel declared a state of war and launched a massive air campaign targeting Hamas strongholds in Gaza. This included intense bombardments that caused thousands of civilian casualties and widespread displacement. By the end of the first month, over 1.4 million Palestinians had been internally displaced, making it the deadliest conflict for Palestinians since the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The situation was further complicated by Gazaâ€™s extensive tunnel network, which posed challenges for Israeli forces attempting to locate hostages and target militants.
The conflict escalated as Israel imposed a "complete siege" on Gaza, cutting off electricity, water, food, and fuel supplies, drawing international criticism for its humanitarian impact. Despite pressure from global leaders like U.S. President Joe Biden, aid to Gaza remained limited during the initial months. Efforts to evacuate civilians were fraught with violence; explosions along designated evacuation routes killed dozens, with both sides blaming each other. As Israeli ground forces invaded northern Gaza in late October 2023, airstrikes targeted densely populated areas such as hospitals and refugee camps, leading to significant civilian casualties and accusations of war crimes against both Israel and Hamas.
The war continued into 2024 with major offensives in southern Gaza, including Rafah. Tens of thousands of civilians were ordered to evacuate amidst heavy bombardments that struck schools, displacement camps, and other civilian infrastructure. International attempts at brokering ceasefires were met with mixed success; while temporary truces allowed for hostage exchanges and limited aid delivery, fighting resumed shortly after each pause. By mid-2024, humanitarian conditions in Gaza had deteriorated severely, with minimal aid reaching the population and widespread destruction across the territory. The United Nations Security Council eventually passed a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian relief efforts, but the long-term resolution of the conflict remained elusive
